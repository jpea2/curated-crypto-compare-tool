Safe design pattern for your quiz (spot-crypto only):

Scope-gate: Only include AUSTRAC-registered DCEs that offer spot crypto for AUD. 
AUSTRAC
+1

Filters > rankings: Let users filter by fees, AUD deposit methods, ID/KYC level, supported coins, support hours; show all matches (no “best for you” labels). (Aligns with ACCC transparency expectations.) 
ACCC

Language: Use neutral, factual phrasing (“supports PayID deposits; maker/taker 0.10%/0.20%”)—avoid opinion words (“best”, “safest”, “we recommend”). See ASIC’s factual vs advice framework.

Disclosures: Show affiliate disclosure and a methodology page describing exactly how results are generated. 
ACCC

If you want, tell me:

the exact exchanges you’ll list, 2) fields/filters you want, and 3) where users are (AU only?). I’ll draft a privacy policy (APP-compliant) + affiliate disclosure + methodology page tailored to your setup. (General info, not legal advice.)
